# "Who she is"  and  "Who is she" ? 

They are both right.

However, the meanings are different, and that’s why they are both correct.

“Who she is” describes precisely that - who she is. 

eg. Cruel is a good word to tell you who she is.

“Who is she” is used as a question to find out more about her.

eg. “I’ve seen that woman somewhere before. Who is she?”
